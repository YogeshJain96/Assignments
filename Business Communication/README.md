## "Not all who Wander are Lost"
Abstract

"All that is gold does not glitter, Not all who Wander are Lost." wisely quoted by J. R. R. Tolkien, questions our prespective and makes us rethink. Have you ever questioned The Existense of the Universe? Have you ever wondered about your purpose in this mighty universe. Only a very few among the 7 billions, rational beings actually think about it. And these people actually believe they are here to make a dent in this universe and these people actually dare to explore, travel, find, learn, and understand. Almost all pronounced men discovered great things and places, generated new ideas, crafted new things while travelling and wandering. The common traits among them was Curiousity to Know Everything about Everything. Actually these people claimed, travelling, wandering and exploring new places actually provided them a wide-lens view of life and unclouded thier mind towards innovation.

If we review the recent stories of majority of the well-established Unicorns(Billion Dollar Startup Business), their basic startup ideas orignated while travelling, wandering, facing problems, and solving the pain point which they faced themselves which eventually resulted in solving the problems of millions. These ideas impacted the lives of millions, and contributed to evolution of our speicies and contributed to make this world a better place to live. These wanderers were found to be more afraid of staying in monotonus situations that were no longer fulfilling and were curious to find more out of life and never regret about the road not taken while they can, hence kickstarted thier journey to explore more.

"Not all who Wander are Lost, few are in the journey to find themselves and make a dent in the universe."
